# OfficeSpaceAdventure-
Text based adventure game

Python mini project based on: https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/tree/master/TLG/rpg

Made changes to a game based off original code.

Game loosely based around Office Space
You are Peter at Initech
Navigate through the rooms
Collect items
Watch out for Lumbergh
Certain items are important for beating the boss, winning the game, or getting a surprise!

Commands:
    go [direction]
    take [item]
    inspect [item]



From original code, I added:
Built out dictionaries for better handling
More rooms
People that say random phrases
A way to inspect items to get description in the room or in inventory
An item that transports you and a way to get back
A winning and losing scenario
A way to beat the boss.
Handling if user enters wrong command

Things I want to implement still:
Make condition to defeat boss as having inspected item, not just in inventory
Provide map
List rooms
Clear console
Multiple items in room
Cleaner organization

To win:

Take the memo from The Hall and the tps report from The Cubicles before going in The Office where you meet Lumbergh.  Then you can take the stapler.  The stapler and the new attitude are required to win when entering Chotchkie's.

Stopping by The Printer Room and taking the printer will transport you!  To get back, you must take the bat in order to destroy the printer.
